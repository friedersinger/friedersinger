# Hi there, I'm Frieder! ðŸ‘‹

## I am proud to be currently enrolled in a program at the Developer Academy that is training career changers to become software developers. This academy is a TÃœV-certified educational institution that provides intensive training in front-end development for 4 to 16 months. With over 34 comprehensive modules, the focus is on developing your own projects, either individually or in agile groups, and receiving guidance all the way from your first lines of code to your first IT job.

## JavaScript is my primary programming language, and I use it to build dynamic and interactive web applications. My proficiency in HTML and CSS, as well as my experience working with Python, C, Java, and basic understanding of SQL databases, enable me to approach software development from various perspectives. Through various web development projects, I have also gained experience with React and Bootstrap 4.

## My diverse skill set allows me to deliver high-quality and efficient solutions. I am always eager for new challenges and continually seeking to expand my knowledge and skills.

## Excitement fills me as I look towards the future, with endless opportunities and possibilities waiting to be discovered. The prospect of creating new and innovative applications that can make a real impact in people's lives inspires and motivates me. The journey ahead may not be easy, but I am ready to put in the hard work and dedication required to achieve my goals. With every line of code, I write, I am one step closer to realizing my dream of becoming a successful software developer.
